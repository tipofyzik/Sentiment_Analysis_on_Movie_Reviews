# Sentiment Analysis of Movie Reviews

## 1. Task formulation
There are movie reviews collected from the internet. Basically, there are 2 datasets: Standford's Large Movie Review Dataset and SAR14 dataset. The goal is to train and evaluate the model(s) that will analyze the custom movie review and determine its overall sentiment.  

I uploaded datasets to google drive, so they can be simply put into the **code** folder for their processing. Datasets are available through this link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ACDrihk3dvMMEIhsVKuf3jsO6Rv7DDbP?usp=drive_link  

The references to the original datasets:  
1. Standford's Large Movie Review Dataset: https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/  
**However, for convenience, I used its .csv version (IMBD dataset) published on kaggle**: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews   
2. SAR14 dataset: https://github.com/daiquocnguyen/SAR14?tab=readme-ov-file  

You can get acquainted with the results on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/code/tipofyzik/sentiment-analysis-of-movie-reviews  

## 2. Program installation
### Requirements 
You need to intall Python with the version 3.11.3 and higher. All required modules to install you can find in the **"requirements.txt"** file. Download the folder "code" from github and the folder "datasets" from google drive. The latter folder put into the first one.  



## 3. How to use
There are three key files for the program to work: **SAR14ConverterToCSV.py**, **config.json**, and **app.py**.
